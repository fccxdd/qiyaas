# Qiyaas

Think Wordle meets Hangman!

## About Qiyaas

Qiyaas is a word game based on numbers. It’s similar to ‘hangman’ with a little detective work. Every puzzle has one noun, one verb, and one adjective. To start you will be given 3 numbers, these represent your clues. Each clue is different and will only appear once. Your task is to do a little problem solving and figure out which clue corresponds to which word. Through some reasoning, and guesswork the puzzle will slowly start to reveal itself, and correctly guessing the words becomes a matter of careful consideration.
